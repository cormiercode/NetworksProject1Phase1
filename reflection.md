For this first phase of the project, I felt like I understood things much more than I had previously! Though I admit I was quite cranky from the last assignment (apologies for the grumpy reflection), I think that it was a very important homework to have for building the foundational knowledge for future assignments. 
For this phase, I worked with Kaia Cormier and also consulted Ramsha Rauf as well as the TA during TA hours. To be quite honest, it only took be about an hour. I worked well with my peers and found that the only difficulty I had was figuring out why when I sent my html file over, the sever opened it in this weird html format. However, the problem was fixed once I switched browswers and used Safari instead of Chrome, so maybe it's just a chrome issue. 
Other than that, I feel like this portion of the assignment was pretty manageable and it felt cool that is had tangeible results that we could play around with!
